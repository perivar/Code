	/// An audio feature is a special attribute designed to describe characteristics
	/// of audiostreams. A audio feature is the result of a audio feature extraction
	/// process.<br>
	/// <br>
	/// Beside describing the characteristic of audio streams, audio features also
	/// support comparing two audio streams. So based on the supported
	/// characterization a metric has to be implemented, which allows to compute the
	/// distance (similarity/dissimilarity) of two audio streams.
