Version 17

Purpose:
--------
  BASS audio library has limited support for reading tags, associated with a
  stream. This library extends that functionality, allowing developer/user to
  extract specific song information from the stream handle used with BASS. The
  extracted tag values are formatted into text ouput according to given format
  string (including conditional processing).

Supported tags:
---------------
  MP3 ID3v1 and ID3v2.2/3/4
  OGG/FLAC comments
  WMA
  APE, OFR, MPC, AAC - all use APE tags
  MP4
  MOD/etc titles

Package contents:
-----------------
  tags.dll
  tags-readme.txt
  c/tags.h
  c/tags.lib
  c/sample/tagscan.cpp
  delphi/tags.pas
  delphi/sample/Project1.dpr
  delphi/sample/unit1.dfm
  delphi/sample/unit1.pas
  vb/tags.bas  
  src/*
  
Usage:
------
  Pretty standard, include the header file, so the function declarations are
  visible in the module, add 'tags.lib' to the list of the libraries to link 
  against (c/c++ only).  See function reference below in this file. Ship tags.dll
  with your program.
  Note: a trick like Ian suggests in BASS loadnget.c example can be used.

Performance:
------------
  A test string of
  "%IFV1(%TRCK,%TRCK. )%IFV2(%ARTI,%ICAP(%ARTI),no artist) - %IFV2(%TITL,%ICAP(%TITL) -,no title -)%IFV1(%ALBM, %IUPC(%ALBM))%IFV1(%YEAR, %(%YEAR%))"
  on Celeron 2.4GHz executes in less than 1 ms. I'd really like to know if this
  will be a problem for anyone.
  
Support:
--------
  - If your compiler doesn't recognize '_stdcall' keyword, you're free to change
    to something appropriate, just   
    #define _stdcall stdcall
  - I await your suggestions and bug reports.
    Please direct all questions to BASS forum, I'll try to answer them there.

APPENDIX
Function reference:
-------------------  
  Function:
    DWORD _stdcall TAGS_GetVersion();
  
  Purpose:
	Returns tags.dll version.
  
  Return value:
    Current version (in HIBYTE) and build (in LOBYTE).
  
  ---------------
  
  Function:
    const char* _stdcall TAGS_Read( 
			DWORD handle,		// bass HSTREAM handle
			const char* fmt		// format string
			);
			
  Purpose:
    Reads tag values from the stream and formats them according to
    given format string.
    
  Parameters:
    handle  - BASS handle, obtained normally via BASS_StreamCreatexx() call,
              or any other handle, on which BASS_ChannelGetTags() can be called.
    fmt		- format string, see below.
  
  Return value:
    - empty string when unable to properly read the tag, or when there are no supported tags.
    - pointer to the beginning of a text string, containing extracted
      values from the song tags, on success;
    - a parser error message text, when format string is ill-formed.
    
  Notes:
    1. format string can contain the following things:
       - plain text like "Some song". This text is merely copied to the output.
       - special identifier, beginning with '%' to substitute for the tag value:
         "%TITL"  - song title;
         "%ARTI"  - song artist;
         "%ALBM"  - album name;
         "%GNRE"  - song genre;
         "%YEAR"  - song/album year;
         "%CMNT"  - comment;
         "%TRCK"  - track number (may include total track count "track/total");
         "%COMP"  - composer;
         "%COPY"  - copyright;
         "%SUBT"  - subtitle;
         "%AART"  - album artist;
         "%DISC"  - disc number (may include total disc count "disc/total");
       - expression:
         "%IFV1(x,a)" - if x is not empty, then %IFV1() evaluates to a, 
                        or to an empty string otherwise;
         "%IFV2(x,a,b)" - if x is not empty, then %IFV2() evaluates to a,
                        else to b;
         "%IUPC(x)" - brings x to uppercase, so "%IUPC(foO)" yields "FOO";
         "%ILWC(x)" - brings x to lowercase, so "%ILWC(fOO)" yields "foo";
         "%ICAP(x)" - capitalizes first letter in each word of x, so
                      "%ICAP(FoO bAR)" yields "Foo Bar";
         "%ITRM(x)" - removes beginning and trailing spaces from x;
         "%UTF8(x)" - encodes the tags in UTF-8 form (otherwise ANSI);

       - escaped symbols:
         "%%" - "%"
         "%(" - "("
         "%," - ","
         "%)" - ")"
       
       Example. Assume we have the following information in the tag:
	     Title: "Nemo"
	     Artist: "nightwish"
	     Album: "Once"
	     Track: "3"
	     Year: "2004"
	     
         Format string: "%IFV1(%TRCK,%TRCK. )%IFV2(%ARTI,%ICAP(%ARTI),no artist) - %IFV2(%TITL,%ICAP(%TITL) -,no title -) %IFV1(%ALBM,%IUPC(%ALBM))%IFV1(%YEAR, %(%YEAR%))"
         Output: "3.- Nightwish - Nemo - ONCE (2004)"
         
         if 'Artist' and 'Title' are empty, the output will be:
         "3. - no artist - no title - ONCE (2004)"
         
         if only 'Track' is empty, the output will be
         "Nightwish - Nemo - ONCE (2004)"

       Caution:
         "%IFV2(sometext ,a,b)" always evaluates to a, because a space after
         "sometext" causes the condition string to be not empty. This is 
         intentional.

       Another caution:
         "symbols '%(,)' are reserved, that is, they must be escaped if they are
         inteded to appear in the output. See the above example: the parens 
         around %YEAR are escaped with '%' to prevent misinterpretation.

    2. Ill-formed string causes some error message to appear in the output, but
	  don't count on it too much...

    3. Great warning:
      The output string is allocated by tags.dll, so deleting the pointer may
      crash the program. DON'T! In addition to this, the function is NOT THREAD SAFE.
      It is user's responsibility to serialize the execution (a critical section
      would suffice). The output string itself is valid till next TAGS_Read() call.

    4. If mp3 contains both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, ID3v2 data takes preceedence.

  -----------------
  Function:
	const char*  _stdcall TAGS_GetLastErrorDesc();

  Purpose:
    For debug; the text description of the last TAGS_Read() call. It may say
    something like:
    "ID3v2 tag: header is invalid", on poorly-added tags.

  Return value:
    an error string, or empty string if no error.

  Notes:
    1. Again, don't delete the return value pointer.
    2. Like TAGS_Read() this function is not thread-safe.
